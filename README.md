# hello-world
First project using GitHub
Hi there. My name is Marcos Fernandes. I live in Rio, Brazil and I am a business consultant with strong focus on solving technology problems for my clients. I am a physicist and most of my work is related to hard tech - meaning not so much software and IT. I am now starting my journey into data science and coding and I think GitHub will be very useful to me as I venture on this journey.
